    Adding_silence_to_audios.ipynb Notebooks. It will have a csv file per

    time to obtain a multiple of 3 seconds.
2. Embeddings_from_3sPadding: This folder will contain the embeddings (in 
    csv format) extracted using birdnet over the audios with the padding 
    silence. To obtain the files you need to run the 1_getting_embeddings.ipynb
